You can use proxies.</p>\r\n<p>There are two main ways to make transparent proxies</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>by creating dynamically a derived class using Reflection.Emit</li>\r\n<li>by creating a transparent proxy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Still there are some drawbacks with both approaches. For the first one, all your members should be made virtual, for the second your class should inherit from MarshalByRefObject. In all case you should then take care not to mess up between proxies and underlying classes.</p>\r\n<p>The main critic to refuse to use Lazy&lt;T&gt; class is usually that it's not a domain concept, and that it leaks persistence concern in the model.</p>\r\n<p>I reject those critics.</p>\r\n<p>Have you ever seen someone criticize List&lt;T&gt; or Dictionary&lt;,&gt; because it was not a domain concept ? <strong>We're writing OO code, and we can use basic tooling to make our models expressive</strong>. IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; and Linq to objects are good examples of these useful tools.</p>\r\n<p>And I don't consider that Lazy&lt;T&gt; is a persistence concern. <strong>It expresses that the relation between entities is a bit more loose than others</strong>. There is nothing in the Lazy&lt;T&gt; signature that ties your entity to any persistence concept. You just provide a way to give the value of the property when needed rather than at construction, but this choice comes from outside of your entity.</p>\r\n<p>And at least it becomes clearer than with derived proxies where the C# keyword <strong>virtual</strong> is used to express something but tries to hide it in the same time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For Chris question, I use the builder in the repository.</p>\r\n<p>The repository is responsible for retrieving entities from the data store. The reconstruction of objects is a bit different from the construction. This is underlined in Evan's book in the chapter <em>Factories / Reconstituting Stored Objects.</em></p>\r\n<p>In my data access layer I use a IDataBuilder&lt;T&gt; interface that represents a service that can build an object of type T from a IDataRecord. This is when I work directly with the ADO.Net and stored procedures.</p>\r\n<div style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #aaaaaa 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #aaaaaa 1px solid; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; BACKGROUND: #f8f8f8; BORDER-LEFT: #aaaaaa 1px solid;

IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\nand Linq to objects are good examples of these useful tools.</p>\n<p>And I don't consider that Lazy&lt;T&gt; is a persistence concern. <strong>It\nexpresses that the relation between entities is a bit more loose than\nothers</strong>. There is nothing in the Lazy&lt;T&gt; signature that ties your\nentity to any persistence concept. You just provide a way to give the value of\nthe property when needed rather than at construction, but this choice comes\nfrom outside of your entity.</p>\n<p>And at least it becomes clearer than with derived proxies where the C#\nkeyword <strong>virtual</strong> is used to express something but tries to hide\nit in the same time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For Chris question, I use the builder in the repository.</p>\n<p>The repository is responsible for retrieving entities from the data store.\nThe reconstruction of objects is a bit different from the construction. This is\nunderlined in Evan's book in the chapter <em>Factories / Reconstituting Stored\nObjects.</em></p>\n<p>In my data access layer I use a IDataBuilder&lt;T&gt; interface that\nrepresents a service that can build an object of type T from a IDataRecord.\nThis is when I work directly with the ADO.Net and stored procedures.</p>\n<div style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #aaaaaa 1px solid;

The services in question are often repositories by the way… </p>\r\n<p>The response is simple : </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>- DO NOT inject services in entities !</strong></p>\r\n<p>- Ok I see, you’re against dependency injection</p>\r\n<p><strong>- NO, I'm not against dependency injection, I use it a lot.</strong></p>\r\n<p>- You can still use a static service locator…</p>\r\n<p><strong>- I avoid service locator when I can, especially when the service locator must be static…</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>– So you’ll get an anemic object model !</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>- I don’t think so.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Injecting services in entities is wrong</h3>\r\n<p>You’ll find me a bit presumptuous, but I say it again : <strong>Injecting services in entities is wrong</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Nesting objects is not a problem from an OO point of view, but we’re talking about a special kind of objects, entities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Entities are all about their state management, and this state management can require several objects.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Code infrastructure objects like lists or dictionary to handle collection of data, </li>\r\n<li>Object oriented constructs to leverage code maintenance techniques like strategies. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Entities don’t have to be classes with public setters and getters… you should even avoid this to keep you entities in a consistent state.</p>\r\n<p>But there is no reason for an entity to keep a reference on a service, since it’s not part of its state.</p>\r\n<p>There are usually three situations in which people thinks they need it :</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lazy loads </li>\r\n<li>Relations </li>\r\n<li>Behavior methods </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Let’s review each point…</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Lazy loads</h4>\r\n<p>Sometimes, an entity property is heavy to load and is not required by all code paths. In this case, loading it upfront can lead to performance problems.</p>\r\n<p>The usual way to work it out is to hold a reference to a data access object or a repository and to load and cache the requested data on demand.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<em>Using a data access layer object in the entity is clearly a break of persistence ignorance, but using a repository is not a better option.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The repository is a way to abstract persistence in the model, but it’s still a persistence concern even if modeled in terms of domain terms.</p>\r\n<p>I’ve already posted about ways to solve this problem in <a href=\"http://www.thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2009/02/07/Lazy-load-and-persistence-ignorance\">Lazy load and persistence ignorance</a> and <a href=\"http://thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2009/02/08/Lazy-loads-and-persistence-ignorance-Part-2\">part 2</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Relations</h4>\r\n<p>I was twitting yesterday with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kbaley\">Kyle Baley</a> about the need to have an Event repository in the Users entity.

inject services entities i’ve seen lot people asking where and how inject services entities the services question are often repositories the way… the response simple not inject services entities see you’re against dependency injection not against dependency injection use lot you can still use static service locator… avoid service locator when can especially when the service locator must static… you’ll get anemic object model don’t think injecting services entities wrong you’ll find bit presumptuous but say again injecting services entities wrong nesting objects not problem from point view but we’re talking about special kind objects entities entities are all about their state management and this state management can require several objects code infrastructure objects like lists dictionary handle collection data object oriented constructs leverage code maintenance techniques like strategies entities don’t have classes with public setters and getters… you should even avoid this keep you entities consistent state but there reason for entity keep reference service since it’s not part its state there are usually three situations which people thinks they need lazy loads relations behavior methods let’s review each point… lazy loads sometimes entity property heavy load and not required all code paths this case loading upfront can lead performance problems the usual way work out hold reference data access object repository and load and cache the requested data demand using data access layer object the entity clearly break persistence ignorance but using repository not better option the repository way abstract persistence the model but it’s still persistence concern even modeled terms domain terms i’ve already posted about ways solve this problem lazy load and persistence ignorance and part relations was twitting yesterday with kyle baley about the need have event repository the users entity wanted get the user team for the current event think you don’t need more context understand the problem the user did not know about the current event needed the event repository find and find the corresponding team but why does the user entity expose currentteam property doesn’t know about events there’s something missing here the whole picture becomes clearer you add participant entity that embodies the participation user event and repository needed anymore since you don’t need currentteam property user make relations clear instead hiding repositories behavior methods have mail message entity and want send method tiding your entity the service that will use not conceptually satisfying the server that will send the message medium and not part the entity itself it’s seems better call server send message the problem that you can end breaking the tell don’t ask principle because the send method will ask the message for each property value and you can tempted put computations that should the message entity inside the send method let’s call double dispatch the rescue design server interface presenting send method that take the parameters need title recipients message body… add sendthrough method your entity that takes the

And the assembly load fails.</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<h2>What’s the solution then ?</h2>\n\n<p>I clearly prefer the specific configuration scheme of NServiceBus, but how can we solve the version problem ?</p>\n\n<p>I will answer with another question :</p>\n\n<p>Why does NServiceBus need <strong>two</strong> IOC container implementations ?</p>\n\n<p>For library creators, I will propose this way to go :</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Choose the container that provides the features you need </li>\n\n  <li>Use it in your infrastructure </li>\n\n  <li>Create a clear configuration model that exposes the required and optional dependencies that should be provided by the library user </li>\n\n  <li>Consider creating a app.config specific configuration (there are good tools in the framework for that) </li>\n\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2009/02/23/LeveragingILMergetosimplifydeploymentandyourusersexperience.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">ILMerge your container framework as internal in your assembly</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The alternative to ILMerge is to fork your framework (if it’s open source) and put it as internal directly in your code.</p>\n\n<h2>The advantages</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>No conflict with potential other versions of the container framework </li>\n\n  <li>A clear discoverable configuration </li>\n\n  <li>No need to use a IOC container to use the library. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What if the container needs to inject dependencies in the user objects ?</h2>\n\n<p>Both NServiceBus and MassTransit instantiate user’s objects on the fly.</p>\n\n<p>How can the user add it’s own dependencies if he has no access to the container ?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s step back a little and consider what we would do if there was no container…</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We would use Activator.CreateInstance to create the object. </li>\n\n  <li>Then we would consider it would not let the library user enough options, so we would propose a hook so that the user can manage the instantiation himself. It could be a callback or an interface. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When instantiating user objects with the internal framework IOC container, you remove to your users the right to manage the instantiation themselves.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So come back to this good practice. If the user wants to use a IOC container to instantiate his objects with dependencies, let him do this his own way. And his container will not be loaded with all the framework internal dependencies, this will avoid other conflicts.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Hide your IOC container framework inside your library, it’s a private implementation detail of your framework and we don’t wanna know !</p>\n\n<p>Choose the framework you like, hide it so that it cannot conflict with the one I want to use and we will be friends !</p>\n\n<p>It surely advocates for frameworks with a small footprint, but once again, it’s a private detail.</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Continued on <a href=\"http://thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2009/05/19/IOC-Container-Go-Hide-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">IOC Container, Go Hide (part 2)</a></p>","<p><a href=\"http://thinkbeforecoding.com/public/WindowsLiveWriter_IOCcontainershouldIknowyou_8FB7_558287_49024807_1__2.jpg\">\n<img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"558287_49024807\" border=\"0\" alt=\"558287_49024807\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://thinkbeforecoding.com/public/WindowsLiveWriter_IOCcontainershouldIknowyou_8FB7_558287_49024807_1__thumb.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"175\" /></a>While testing <a href=\"http://www.nservicebus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NServiceBus</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/\" target=\"_blank\">MassTransit</a> – yes I\nneed a service bus framework for my current project – I’ve seen that both\nlibrary where relying on an IOC container, in two different ways.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: This article is not to flame these two frameworks that seems of\ngreat quality.

masstransit yes need service bus framework for current project i’ve seen that both library where relying ioc container two different ways warning this article not flame these two frameworks that seems great quality there are still few guidance using ioc containers libraries this the topic this post the nservicebus way nservicebus relies spring castle windsor you can notice when instantiating the bus var bus nservicebus configure with springbuilder castlewindsorbuilder msmqsubscriptionstorage xmlserializer msmqtransport istransactional true purgeonstartup false unicastbus impersonatesender false createbus start and when looking the library with reflector and yes the spring framework and the castle windsor are ilmerged the nservicebus assembly nservicebus abstracts the container with the nservicebus objectbuilder ibuilder interface public interface ibuilder methods build object build type typetobuild ienumerable buildall ienumerable object buildall type typetobuild void buildanddispatch type typetobuild action object action the masstransit way masstransit adopts slightly different strategy the base still the same uses the commonservicelocator have ‘standard’ interface hide the actual ioc container implementation provides implementations for the most common ioc frameworks castle windsor ninject structuremap and unity but doesn’t work well… through additional dlls the big difference the library configuration you configure the container through code configuration then encapsulate the container common service locator implementation that acts adapter finally give the library what’s the problem both case the intent good but hell paved with good intentions mass transit the design clearly made that you can choose your container and integrate the library seamlessly with you can manage the configuration your container the way you your application but wait what don’t need ioc container application the other problem that mass transit relies some advanced ioc capabilities like contextual configuration the object instantiated for iendpoint should not the same depending the parent object this scenario not handled unity for instance maybe unity not good enough but how can know which other specific feature mass transit relies clue and providing library configuration through container doesn’t seem best practice the api gives clues what should provide the library order run the only way know launch see where throws unresolved dependency exception add the dependency and retry and i’ll probably never know about optional dependencies the other side nservicebus works with nservicebus specific configuration code and app config that indicates clearly what must provide the library but jak charlton had serious problem with nservicebus he’s not using the same version castle windsor that the one merged the nsb assembly and the assembly load fails what’s the solution then clearly prefer the specific configuration scheme nservicebus but how can solve the version problem will answer with another question why does nservicebus need two ioc container implementations for library creators will propose this way choose the container that provides the features you need use your infrastructure create clear configuration model that exposes the required and optional dependencies that should provided the library user consider creating app config specific configuration there are good tools the framework for that ilmerge your container framework internal your assembly the alternative ilmerge fork your framework it’s open source and put internal directly your code the advantages conflict with potential other versions the container framework clear discoverable configuration need use ioc container use the library what the container needs inject dependencies the user objects both nservicebus and masstransit instantiate user’s objects the fly how can the user add it’s own dependencies has access the container let’s step back little and consider what would there was container… would use activator createinstance create the object then would consider would not let the library user enough options would propose hook that the user can manage the instantiation himself could callback interface when instantiating user objects with the internal framework ioc container you remove your users the right manage the instantiation themselves come back this good practice the user wants use ioc container instantiate his objects with dependencies let him this his own way and his container will not loaded with all the framework internal dependencies this will avoid other conflicts conclusion hide your ioc container framework inside your library it’s private implementation detail your framework and don’t wanna know choose the framework you like hide that cannot conflict with the one want use and will friends surely advocates for frameworks with small footprint but once again it’s private detail continued ioc container hide

I began then to notice problems concerning code and data locality.</p>\r\n<p>When you have a single application (process), no problem.</p>\r\n<p>But if two applications need to modify the same entities, the solution would be to use the same library in both applications so that there is no code duplication. It seems good practice but you quickly stumble on several problems – I’m sure you already experienced it :</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Synchronization : the same data will be accessed in the same db from two application, how do you manage conflicts</li>\r\n<li>Deployment : when you fix bugs or add features, you must redeploy every application that has a dependency on the library. It slows down the release cycle and make it more risky, changes have more impact.</li>\r\n<li>Code locality : when a problem arises, you have to find which application it comes from.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Let’s examine DDD patterns to see how they fit with reuse :</p>\r\n<h4>Services</h4>\r\n<p>Let’s start easy. Services are stateless, they should deliver simple action. But to preserve encapsulation the better is to put services as true services in their own process (web service, windows service, service on a service bus..).</p>\r\n<p>This way, synchronization is managed in process, deployment is a breeze, and no problem with code locality – code executes in one place.</p>\r\n<h4>Entities</h4>\r\n<p>Entities are retrieved through a Repository Service, hence, they should follow the same rules as Services.</p>\r\n<p>This way, the implementation of a repository that access the database is truly an implementation details. Anyone who wants to talk to an entity sends a command to it, a handler service get the entity from the repository, and pass the command to the entity. The configuration to access the database is local the to the process.</p>\r\n<p>Here again, same benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover entities should always have different meanings in different bounded contexts, the should have different implementations, so there is no real reason for reuse.</p>\r\n<h4>Value Objects</h4>\r\n<p>Value objects are a bit different.</p>\r\n<p>Some object are very specific to a bounded context and don’t need to be reuse outside.</p>\r\n<p>Some other can be a good way to encapsulate some shared concepts.

I began then to\nnotice problems concerning code and data locality.</p>\n<p>When you have a single application (process), no problem.</p>\n<p>But if two applications need to modify the same entities, the solution would\nbe to use the same library in both applications so that there is no code\nduplication. It seems good practice but you quickly stumble on several problems\n– I’m sure you already experienced it :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronization : the same data will be accessed in the same db from two\napplication, how do you manage conflicts</li>\n<li>Deployment : when you fix bugs or add features, you must redeploy every\napplication that has a dependency on the library. It slows down the release\ncycle and make it more risky, changes have more impact.</li>\n<li>Code locality : when a problem arises, you have to find which application\nit comes from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s examine DDD patterns to see how they fit with reuse :</p>\n<h4>Services</h4>\n<p>Let’s start easy. Services are stateless, they should deliver simple action.\nBut to preserve encapsulation the better is to put services as true services in\ntheir own process (web service, windows service, service on a service\nbus..).</p>\n<p>This way, synchronization is managed in process, deployment is a breeze, and\nno problem with code locality – code executes in one place.</p>\n<h4>Entities</h4>\n<p>Entities are retrieved through a Repository Service, hence, they should\nfollow the same rules as Services.</p>\n<p>This way, the implementation of a repository that access the database is\ntruly an implementation details. Anyone who wants to talk to an entity sends a\ncommand to it, a handler service get the entity from the repository, and pass\nthe command to the entity. The configuration to access the database is local\nthe to the process.</p>\n<p>Here again, same benefits.</p>\n<p>Moreover entities should always have different meanings in different bounded\ncontexts, the should have different implementations, so there is no real reason\nfor reuse.</p>\n<h4>Value Objects</h4>\n<p>Value objects are a bit different.</p>\n<p>Some object are very specific to a bounded context and don’t need to be\nreuse outside.</p>\n<p>Some other can be a good way to encapsulate some shared concepts. Money is\nusually a good example, but there can also be concepts more specific to the\ndomain (you will find them as words that come in the Ubiquitous Language of\ndifferent Bounded Contexts).</p>\n<p>They can be shared among different contexts, but rarely between different\ndomains. There are exceptions for very very generic concept like money, but\neven money often needs to be tweaked a bit for each domain…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Service Bus to the rescue</h3>\n<p>Once each bounded context is split, you need to organize communications\nbetween parts. Here comes the Service Bus and Messages, but now, the only\nshared parts in the application are :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Object model extensions (to code faster and cleaner)</li>\n<li>Technical infrastructure (so that each process is fully equipped, and\nthere’s not much technical fuss in the application code)</li>\n<li>General use Value Objects (to manipulate domain concepts instead of int and\ndecimal)</li>\n<li>Messages (to communicate between contexts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You could also use web services, but it makes the overall structure less\nfault tolerant, harder to deploy, and more tightly coupled.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve decoupled bounded context using messages, the rest is just an\ninternal implementation detail, why would you want to reuse it !</p>","","ddd and code reuse read several discussions against code reuse and layered architectures recently the fallacy reuse udi dahan webcast soa the van udi dahan feature feature oren eini different kinds code reuse you can split your code with different concern object model extensions technical infrastructure application code the first two are good candidates for code reuse object model extensions i’m talking about things that make your code writing less tedious language level object model level example such code are ienumerable and enumerable collections reflection helpers dependency injection framework technical infrastructure mean things that make your code run its environment generic service host orm data layer format serializers deserializers configuration helpers communication frameworks wcf service buses frameworks mvc wpf the last part application code and here things are really different application code reuse for long i’ve been writing business code libraries began then notice problems concerning code and data locality when you have single application process problem but two applications need modify the same entities the solution would use the same library both applications that there code duplication seems good practice but you quickly stumble several problems i’m sure you already experienced synchronization the same data will accessed the same from two application how you manage conflicts deployment when you fix bugs add features you must redeploy every application that has dependency the library slows down the release cycle and make more risky changes have more impact code locality when problem arises you have find which application comes from let’s examine ddd patterns see how they fit with reuse services let’s start easy services are stateless they should deliver simple action but preserve encapsulation the better put services true services their own process web service windows service service service bus this way synchronization managed process deployment breeze and problem with code locality code executes one place entities entities are retrieved through repository service hence they should follow the same rules services this way the implementation repository that access the database truly implementation details anyone who wants talk entity sends command handler service get the entity from the repository and pass the command the entity the configuration access the database local the the process here again same benefits moreover entities should always have different meanings different bounded contexts the should have different implementations there real reason for reuse value objects value objects are bit different some object are very specific bounded context and don’t need reuse outside some other can good way encapsulate some shared concepts money usually good example but there can also concepts more specific the domain you will find them words that come the ubiquitous language different bounded contexts they can shared among different contexts but rarely between different domains there are exceptions for very very generic concept like money but even money often needs tweaked bit for each domain… service bus the rescue once each bounded context split you need organize communications between parts here comes the service bus and messages but now the only shared parts the application are object model extensions code faster and cleaner technical infrastructure that each process fully equipped and there’s not much technical fuss the application code general use value objects manipulate domain concepts instead int and decimal messages communicate between contexts you could also use web services but makes the overall structure less fault tolerant harder deploy and more tightly coupled once you’ve decoupled bounded context using messages the rest just internal implementation detail why would you want reuse","a:1:{s:3:\"tag\";a:4:{i:0;s:32:\"Distributed Domain Driven Design\";i:1;s:11:\"Service Bus\";i:2;s:20:\"Domain Driven Design\";i:3;s:6:\"Design\";}}","1","0","1","1","0","1","0"

night should really tell neighbors that 3am not the good time move their furniture all around the flat you can find requests for static methods interfaces all over the internet but there are good reasons not according eric lippert the main reasons the difference inheritance between static methods and instance method the absence shared slots between static methods mixing both static methods and instance methods interfaces would lead real nightmare when you try understand what really happens but why does this question arise often then what’s really needed static classes type instances let’s take simple class with both static and instance members class sample static part private static int count public static int count get return count instance part private readonly string name public sample string name this name name public void method count console writeline quot total count incremented quot count name here count static property static part different from instance part that static part exist only once per type but could see static part being object with reference type name why would these object not have interfaces let refactor this bit public class sample2 public sealed class sample2class internal int count public int count get return count public static readonly sample2class class new sample2class private readonly string name public sample2 string name this name name public void method class count console writeline quot total count incremented quot class count name here the only static member class that acts singleton for the type note that had change the count modifier internal the behavior not the same but it’s conceptually equivalent can make something less extreme public class sample3 private static int count public static int count get return count private readonly string name public static readonly sample3class class new sample3class public sealed class sample3class public int count get return sample3 count public sample3 string name this name name public void method count console writeline quot total count incremented quot count name here added only proxy public methods and properties the singleton class could define interface that would implemented sample3class that would provide the missing slot concept that eric lipperts talk about can also see here that there point mixing static and instance method interface since inheritance rules differs static interface imagination work let’s define static interface can define static classes public static interface icountable static int count get and implement our sample public class sample4 icountable private static int count public static int count get return count private readonly string name public sample4 string name this name name public void method count

The boss is an employee.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Now, we can model a Boss property on the Company Aggregate Root that will reference the employee that is the boss. Changing the boss can now be an atomic and consistent operation.</p>\r\n<p>We can see that we had to introduce a upper level to manage it (we’ll se it in the Scope section).</p>\r\n<h3>n Cardinality</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Employee should have different user names.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We can clearly see here that user names must be different because they’ll act as identifiers.

basic event sourcing infrastructure get the beta visual studio 2010 we’ll using dynamic features straight our goal then event storage let’s hide the ugly details the event storage behind two simple interfaces public interface ieventstorage idisposable iaggregaterootstorage tid getaggregaterootstore taggregateroot tid where taggregateroot aggregateroot tid public interface iaggregaterootstorage tid void append tid ienumerable object events ienumerable object this tid get and start with minimal memory implementation the event storage first public class eventstorage ieventstorage private

stores trygetvalue typeof taggregateroot out store store new aggregaterootstorage tid stores add typeof taggregateroot store return store public void dispose stores clear here could replace dynamic object and cast requested type return use dynamic because this kind code not compile time safe anyway there’s specific storage for each aggregate root type especially depending identifier type for type safety then the aggregaterootstorage class aggregaterootstorage tid iaggregaterootstorage tid private readonly dictionary tid list object store new dictionary tid list object public void append tid ienumerable object events list object aggregaterootevents store trygetvalue out aggregaterootevents aggregaterootevents new list object store add aggregaterootevents aggregaterootevents addrange events public ienumerable object this tid get return store simply stores list events associated with aggregate root identifier the aggregate root aggregate roots manage uncommitted events public interface iuncommittedevents ienumerable object bool hasevents get void commit the interface can indicates whether there are events returns the events and clears the uncommitted events committing quick implementation internal class uncommittedevents iuncommittedevents private readonly list object events new list object public void append object event events add event ienumerator object ienumerable object getenumerator return events getenumerator public bool hasevents get return events count void iuncommittedevents commit events clear ienumerator ienumerable getenumerator return events getenumerator nothing tricky here neither now the iaggregateroot interface used the repository gives access the uncommitted events public interface iaggregateroot out tid tid get iuncommittedevents uncommittedevents get the aggregateroot class will maintain the uncommitted events public abstract class aggregateroot tid iaggregateroot tid private readonly uncommittedevents uncommittedevents new uncommittedevents protected void replay ienumerable object events dynamic this foreach var event events apply event protected void append object event uncommittedevents append event public abstract tid get iuncommittedevents iaggregateroot tid uncommittedevents get return uncommittedevents the append method will use child class append events after they are applied the replay method used the child class constructor rebuild the aggregate root state from events here use dynamic variable dispatch events specific child class apply methods net implementation would use reflection dispatch events apply methods the uncommittedevents property implemented explicitly that does not appear standard class use the repository the repository just very slightly longer added session concept that several repositories can submit changes single transaction internal interface isessionitem void submitchanges public abstract class repository tid taggregateroot isessionitem

dynamic event uncommittedevents domainevents raise event the constructor enlist the repository current session the add method registers the aggregate root the repository its events will persisted submitchanges the indexer finds entity already memory loads from the event store the abstract createinstance method implementation will responsible for instantiation submit changes does what expected and also publish committed events will see the trick with dynamic events when analyze domain events the session and its factory just group the submitchanges several repositories public interface

uncommittedevents property the first ctor used load the aggregate root the second one used build new aggregate root the public methods lend and return are the commands the aggregate root defined the ubiquitous language the structure always the same validate arguments and state prepare state transition using domain logic apply state transition domain logic should happen here append state transition uncommitted events the first ctor uses dynamic dispatch each event object the corresponding specific apply method case you implement the pattern previous version advised provide replay method the base class that will perform the dynamic dispatch based reflection that’s all for the entity orm mapping… easy the repository often clearer provide specific repository interface that exposes only available methods with event sourcing it’s not that useful… we’ll write anyway case you’d like use dependency injection the interface part the domain and should the same assembly the entity and the events public interface ibookrepository void add book book book this bookid get the implementation will simply derive from the repository base class can the application assembly internal class bookrepository repository bookid book ibookrepository protected override book createinstance bookid ienumerable object events return new book events add and the indexer are implemented the base class the only thing provide way instantiate the class with expected parameters could use activator createinstance reflection provide generic implementation choose make simpler read the query context the report database we’ll mimic reporting table book lent state this would the data returned from table rows public class bookstate public bookid get set public string title get set public bool lent get set and this will hide the data table implementation public interface ibookstatequery ienumerable bookstate getbookstates bookstate getbookstate bookid ienumerable bookstate getlentbooks void addbookstate bookid string title void setlent bookid bool lent can simply query data report the and update data state implementation will memory for now class bookstatequery ibookstatequery

could tell the base class to\ndispatch then Append then event to UncommittedEvents.</p>\n<p>This way you end with something like :</p>\n<div style=\"BORDER-BOTTOM: #a0a0a0 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT:

post used dynamic replay events the main reason use was avoid long code using reflection the infrastructure that would have made hard read i’ll show several ways this dispatch with pros and cons each cases dynamic the proposed solution was using dynamic pros there reflection code involved code very simple cons all state change apply methods must have the same name made performance test cannot judge perf better not seems that the dlr has rather good cache when the same type encountered several time but only measures can tell handlers registration this the current implementation mark nijhof’s sample the base class maintains dictionary type action association dispatch events based type since action delegate must have target instance the delegate must constructed from within the instance the ctor public class aggregateroot tid readonly dictionary type action object handlers new dictionary type action object protected void register action handler handlers add typeof handler protected void replay ienumerable object events foreach var event events handlers event gettype event rest the aggregate root class here code that use public class book aggregateroot bookid private readonly bookid public book bookid ienumerable object events this replay events public book bookid string title string isbn this var event new bookregistered title isbn onbookregistered event append event private book bookid this register bookregistered onbookregistered register booklent onbooklent register bookreturned onbookreturned private void onbookregistered bookregistered event private void onbooklent booklent event private void onbookreturned bookreturned event pros still reflection meaningful method names cons additional plumbing code private constructor avoid repetition registration occurs each instantiation convention based method naming this the way advocated greg young your event called bookregistered assume the method will called onbookregistered and find reflection you can implement cache class level avoid reflection each dispatch public abstract class aggregateroot tid iaggregateroot tid private static readonly dictionary type ieventdispatcher

static class eventhandler public static ieventhandler create methodinfo methodinfo var eventtype methodinfo getparameters parametertype return ieventhandler activator createinstance typeof eventhandler makegenerictype typeof eventtype methodinfo the trick here create static delegate with two parameters from instance method info that take one parameter and one implicit this target this way the delegate not tied specific instance and can used any target you can see this option requires more code did not want start with that pros convention base names mean manual mapping mapping implicit binding made class level instead instance level cons only unit tests can tell when you mess with names not immune event name change should have good unit tests apply then append also had remark that forget append after apply i’ll get trouble handler registration option and convention base method naming the dispatch can done the base class could tell the base class dispatch then append then event uncommittedevents this way you end with something like var event new booklent play event where play dispatches the event the right method and appends this way you cannot forget problem with this especially the convention base method naming scenario that nobody references the event application methods anymore resharper will report them unused methods and you won’t know unless you run unit tests moreover you pay the cost dynamic dispatch when you know your event type perhaps something like this could better var event new booklent play event with onbooklent the implementation not very complicated public class aggregateroot tid private readonly uncommittedevents uncommittedeents protected eventplayer tevent play tevent tevent event return new eventplayer tevent event uncommitedevents rest the code here public struct eventplayer tevent private readonly tevent event private readonly uncommittedevents uncommittedevents internal eventplayer tevent event uncommittedevents uncommittedevents this event event this uncommittedevents uncommittedevents public void with action tevent handler handler event uncommittedevents append event this way methods are

Whatever, there was barely not enough place already in the Italian restaurant where we moved after.</p>\r\n<p>I won’t make a full report, just talk about some interesting points. </p>\r\n<p>First of all, the session focused mainly on why you should do CQRS and not how. Second point, the talk was not about event sourcing, but you already now that you can do CQRS without event sourcing.</p>\r\n<h2>Something we should accept : Stale Data</h2>\r\n<p>The paradigm of usual architecture’s best practice has a serious flow : when you show data to your users, it’s already stale.</p>\r\n<p>Is it important ? Yes.</p>\r\n<p>Is it a problem ? Not really.</p>\r\n<p>The world have worked with stale data for years, and it was handled rather gracefully until now. Computers have reduced the time span, but when the data appear on the screen, it’s stale.</p>\r\n<p>Tel it to your users, they will accept it. Find with them what is acceptable. 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day ? The users are used to it in there own business. Do it too.</p>\r\n<h2>Queries</h2>\r\n<p>What’s the purpose of queries ? To show data. Not objects.</p>\r\n<p>So why should the data from the database come across 5 layers through 3 model transformations ? It’s a bit overkill to display data.</p>\r\n<p>Why not just this : The UI read data from the database and displays it ?</p>\r\n<p>No DTOs, no ORM, not business rules executed on each query.</p>\r\n<p>You simply define a <strong>Persistent ViewModel</strong> (thank’s Udi, I like this description of the Q side), and display it directly to screen. It should be as simple as one database table per UI view.</p>\r\n<p>Of course you need a way to keep the Persistent ViewModel up to date, but we’ll see that later.</p>\r\n<h2>Commands</h2>\r\n<p>On the other side, there are commands. </p>\r\n<p>It should be done in 3 phases :</p>\r\n<h3>Validation</h3>\r\n<p>Is the input potentially good ? Structured correctly, no missing field, everything fit in ranges ?</p>\r\n<p>This can be done without knowing current state, and be done outside of entities command handling.</p>\r\n<h3>Rules</h3>\r\n<p>Should we do this ?</p>\r\n<p>Here, the decision is taken using current state.</p>\r\n<p>It leads to a discussion about UI design. In order to handle the user command as well as you can, you have to capture the user intent in the command.</p>\r\n<p>In CRUD applications, the new data is sent by the UI layer. You have to extract the user intent from that data to know if you can process the data.</p>\r\n<p>There is a huge difference between UserMovesToNewAddress and CorrectTheMisspellingInUserAddress from a business point, but in a CRUD application you would probably end with the same Update data…</p>\r\n<h3>State change</h3>\r\n<p>What’s the new state ?</p>\r\n<p>It’s the easy part once the rules are applied.</p>\r\n<h2>Domain Model</h2>\r\n<h3>What aren’t they for ?</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Validation</strong> : commands are validated before the model is called. Do not bloat your domain model with this.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Queries</strong> : entity relationships for reading are unnecessary. You can do eager loading on your Aggregate Roots safely, they’ll never be used for queries that need only partial information.</p>\r\n<h3>What are they for ?</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Answer to the question</strong> : should we do what this valid command is asking ?</p>\r\n<p>If the answer is yes, <strong>change the state</strong> !</p>\r\n<h2>Maintain the query model up to date</h2>\r\n<p>There are two main ways to maintain query model up to date.</p>\r\n<p>You can use something like views or ETL to transform data from the domain data to the shape required by the query side.</p>\r\n<p>If you prefer, or when your domain persistence is not compatible with this option (OODB, Event Storage..), you can publish events from you command side, and provides handler’s on the query side that will maintain the views state in the relational database (or a cube… or whatever). A denormalization will happen here.</p>\r\n<h2>What do we gain from this ?</h2>\r\n<h3>Asynchronous model</h3>\r\n<p>The model is deeply asynchronous, it’s not a matter of tweaking things with threads. It’s asynchronous from the ground up, at domain level.</p>\r\n<p>Your user sends a command, and your design is good if you can answer : “thank you, we will come back to you soon…”. Take the time needed to fulfill your user wish, he will be happy !</p>\r\n<h3>Scalability</h3>\r\n<p>By relaxing the rules, the system becomes more scalable.</p>\r\n<h3>Domain persistence choice</h3>\r\n<p>The domain is accessed only to process rules and state changes. There is no need to join tables, filter rows. So you can easily use an non relational database.</p>\r\n<p>Possible options are a OODB or an Event Storage (for event sourcing).</p>\r\n<p>You can still use a RDBMS with or without an ORM if you’re more familiar with these technologies.</p>\r\n<p>But the persistence mechanism becomes an implementation detail from from Command side that will not interfere with your queries.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Ooops, I said it was not a complete report… but it actually is. Every point was interesting ?</p>\r\n<p>After the talk we had a discussion about forecasting and other interesting subjects. Perhaps more on this later.</p>\r\n<p>There was a video camera in the room, so I think the guys from Zenika will try to put it on the internet when they have time. I’ll add the link when available.</p>\r\n<p>If you was here and have a picture of the event, I would be glad to put it in the blog :D</p>","<p><a href=\"http://www.udidahan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Udi Dahan</a> gave a very\ngood talk yesterday evening at Zenika, there was only few attendees… perhaps\nbecause it was on a Monday evening.

Only state needed to take state change decisions will stay\nin memory.</p>","","event sourcing and cqrs bounded contexts once again prefer new post that long comment reply this one about important concept domain driven design bounded contexts hendry luk asked just question you represent borrower events simple full name string there any reason just for sake simplicity for example supposed using borrowerid how would that work other say latebooknotifier let assume its separate how does this shows the name the borrower does communicate directly with command using acl does also subscribe borrowerregistered event well hence every would have duplicate data each the borrowers just like they each the books the short answer ‘yes was just for sake simplicity’ real world scenario borrowers would probably entities and thus would have identity would even probably aggregate root the borrower aggregate root would encapsulate state needed perform commands this aggregate bounded contexts communications can see the following contexts here inventory manage books availability and state the book has been damaged there notes written etc relationships manage contact email phone with borrowers and tracks the care they take your books they return schedule since are using cqrs and even more event sourcing aggregates these context don’t need more state that what’s needed take decisions book the inventory context will probably not need more that the the borrower and the date witch was borrowed can then call the returntoshelf command the book that will publish returnedlatetoshelf book bookid borrowerid after days lateby days handler the relationships boundary will catch the event and call checkexcuseforlatereturn the borrower aggregate root based its the command will check the borrower’ss record see its acceptable will simply publish latereturngentlyaccepted the borrower usually time but will publish kindnesslimitreached the other case another handler will catch and call sendangrymessage the messaging service the role the messaging service tweet borrowers let them know they should not forget return your books how does this service know the twitter account the borrower when the handler the one that call sendangrymessage catches borrowerregistered event borrowertwitteraccountchanged message says the service that can maintain list accounts any desired storage slq nosql memory the sendangrymessage can now tweet ‘hey you filthy borrower you better return book today shall share all the pics from your last party…’ done where does data live there’s usually huge concern about data duplication all contexts the info duplicated many places there will two main places the persistent view model used see and edit borrower’s details the persistent view model used the messaging service query borrower’s twitter accounts here other borrower’s data needed except its and account name the borrower aggregate root and book aggregate root the two main domain bounded contexts will not need keep track this kind data they won’t need their decision process you pursue this idea answer further leonardo you’ll notice that strings will probably never been used state inside domain bounded context they can appear identity key just pass through command and republished the following event but since strings are rarely never good way represent information which you’ll have take decision should almost never stored aggregate root current state this another reason why most domain models can fit memory because names descriptions and other documents usually represent the biggest part the data system the remaining data usually small these documents and names are useless run domain internal logic except validation rules but not state change rules they can simply logged events and persisted the query’s view models only state needed take state change decisions will stay memory","a:1:{s:3:\"tag\";a:3:{i:0;s:20:\"Domain Driven Design\";i:1;s:14:\"Event Sourcing\";i:2;s:4:\"CQRS\";}}","1","0","1","1","8","0","0"

You simply declare your <s>db</s>&nbsp;data schema, your UI and services and bind it all together. </p>\r\n<p>But it doesn’t fit well with CQRS and Event Sourcing. And I want to do Event Sourcing for domain and business reasons, not technical reasons.</p>\r\n<p>But he was write on this point :</p>\r\n<p>I don’t want to write SQL to denormalize my events to my queryable storage.</p>\r\n<p>What are my options ?</p>\r\n<ul>   <li>Writing SQL by hand, but testability is low, and you’ll get a mix of C# to get data from the events, and SQL for the Update queries. </li>\r\n<li>Using an ORM. When doing NHibernate you don’t really write SQL. Testability wont be great anyway. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The problem with ORMs</h2>\r\n<p>ORM are usually better at getting data than at changing it. You can do it, but let’s look at what happens.</p>\r\n<p>The ORM loads data from your Db into entities that will be tracked by an identity tracker. Then you change the values in memory . Then the ORM will find what needs to be sent back to the server and make a query to the Db so that the change happens.</p>\r\n<p>But what I need to do is a lot simpler. Just emit some INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE based on current table values and event data.</p>\r\n<p>With an ORM, what happens if the data is changed between loading and saving ? I’ll have to manage some versioning and/or transaction. And I’ll make two roundtrips to the server needlessly.</p>\r\n<h2>Here comes Duck</h2>\r\n<p>Duck is a kind of ORM oriented toward Delete Update Create.</p>\r\n<p>Don’t ask Duck to load data in memory, it simply can’t. </p>\r\n<p>You simply express how data should change based on current row content and values that you’ll pass.</p>\r\n<p>It avoids the first roundtrip to the database, and make shorter code to express the change.</p>\r\n<h2>Let’s see how to use it</h2>\r\n<p>First, you should declare a class that has the structure of your table with public get/set properties, and marked with a Table attribute :</p>\r\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">	[<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Table</span>]<br />	<span style=\"color: blue\">class</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span><br />	{<br />		<span style=\"color: blue\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Guid</span> Id { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />		<span style=\"color: blue\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: blue\">string</span> Name { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />		<span style=\"color: blue\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: blue\">string</span> BinomialName { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />		<span style=\"color: blue\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: blue\">bool</span> IsEndangered { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />		<span style=\"color: blue\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: blue\">int</span> Population { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />	}</pre>\r\n<p>It contains current observed species at an observatory.</p>\r\n<p>Then a simple new statement, let’s say that a new species has be registered at the observatory :</p>\r\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">	<span style=\"color: blue\">var</span> duck = <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">DuckContext'(connectionString)</span>;<br />	<span style=\"color: blue\">var</span> speciesId = <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Guid</span>.NewGuid();<br />	duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />	    .Insert(() =&gt; <br />	       <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span><br />	       {<br />		Id = speciesId,<br />	         Name = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">\"Mallard\"</span>,<br />		BinomialName = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">\"Anas platyrhynchos\"</span>,<br />		IsEndangered = <span style=\"color: blue\">false</span>,<br />		Population = 50<br />	       });</pre>\r\n<p>Nothing tricky here..</p>\r\n<p>The observatory noticed a population decay, the species is endangered :</p>\r\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">	duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />	    .Where(r =&gt; r.Id == speciesId)<br />	    .Update(r =&gt; <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span> {<br />              Population = r.Population - 40,<br />              IsEndangered = <span style=\"color: blue\">true</span>});</pre>\r\n<p>Here, the use of the current value of Population will not load current value. It will the following statement :</p>\r\n<p>UPDATE Species\r\n<br />SET\r\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Population = Population - 40,\r\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IsEndangered = 1\r\n<br />WHERE\r\n<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Id = @p0</p>\r\n<p>I chose&nbsp; to create a new Row from the old one rather than change the original one for two reasons :</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It makes rows immutable and you don’t have to think about execution order between fields assignments. It’s the way SQL works </li>\r\n<li>Linq Expressions cannot represent statement blocks and assignments in C#3, Duck would have been .Net only… </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The –40 is directly in the query here because we used a constant. I we where using a variable, query would contain a parameter </p>\r\n<p>Now the species has disappeared, it should be removed from the observed species (though it could be just an update somewhere else) :</p>\r\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">	duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />	    .Where(r =&gt; r.Id == speciesId)<br />	    .Delete();</pre>\r\n<h2>Testability</h2>\r\n<p>To run your test you just have to use the InMemoryDuckContext… you have then access to Table&lt;T&gt;() that’ll enable you to set up your data and verify after execution that things changed as expected. I’ll talk a bit more about it soon.</p>\r\n<h2>Try it now, it’s OSS</h2>\r\n<p>You can grab the code at bitbucket and try it now :</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck\" href=\"http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck\" target=\"_blank\">http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck</a></p>\r\n<p>It’s in F# ! Writing a AST analyzer in F# is far more easy, concise and expressive than in C#. You’ll just have to reference Duck in you project, there’s no direct F# dependency.</p>\r\n<p>Next episode will be about how to mix it with Rx (Reactive Framework) to declare your event handling logic.</p>\r\n<p>Hope you like it, and don’t hesitate to give feedback and suggestions.</p>","<p><img style=\"display: inline; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0\" title=\"Duck sign, Stockbridge High Street\" alt=\"Duck sign, Stockbridge High Street\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/21/35/213574_3470e842.jpg\" width=\"188\" height=\"251\" />I recently had a remark from Frederic Fadel from\nAspectize, telling me about Event Sourcing something like:</p>\n<p>Why would you like to write SQL to write data to your read model when our\nproduct can do it for you ?</p>\n<p>I acknowledge that their product is fancy.

When doing NHibernate you don’t really write SQL. Testability\nwont be great anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The problem with ORMs</h2>\n<p>ORM are usually better at getting data than at changing it. You can do it,\nbut let’s look at what happens.</p>\n<p>The ORM loads data from your Db into entities that will be tracked by an\nidentity tracker. Then you change the values in memory . Then the ORM will find\nwhat needs to be sent back to the server and make a query to the Db so that the\nchange happens.</p>\n<p>But what I need to do is a lot simpler. Just emit some INSERT, UPDATE or\nDELETE based on current table values and event data.</p>\n<p>With an ORM, what happens if the data is changed between loading and saving\n? I’ll have to manage some versioning and/or transaction. And I’ll make two\nroundtrips to the server needlessly.</p>\n<h2>Here comes Duck</h2>\n<p>Duck is a kind of ORM oriented toward Delete Update Create.</p>\n<p>Don’t ask Duck to load data in memory, it simply can’t.</p>\n<p>You simply express how data should change based on current row content and\nvalues that you’ll pass.</p>\n<p>It avoids the first roundtrip to the database, and make shorter code to\nexpress the change.</p>\n<h2>Let’s see how to use it</h2>\n<p>First, you should declare a class that has the structure of your table with\npublic get/set properties, and marked with a Table attribute :</p>\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">\n     [<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Table</span>]<br />       <span style=\"color: blue\">class</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span><br />   {<br />         <span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Guid</span> Id { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />          <span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">string</span> Name { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />         <span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">string</span> BinomialName { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />         <span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">bool</span> IsEndangered { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />           <span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">int</span> Population { <span style=\"color: blue\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue\">set</span>; }<br />      }\n</pre>\n<p>It contains current observed species at an observatory.</p>\n<p>Then a simple new statement, let’s say that a new species has be registered\nat the observatory :</p>\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">\n     <span style=\"color: blue\">var</span> duck = <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">DuckContext'(connectionString)</span>;<br /> <span style=\"color: blue\">var</span> speciesId = <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Guid</span>.NewGuid();<br />      duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />          .Insert(() =&gt; <br />            <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span><br />             {<br />          Id = speciesId,<br />            Name = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">&quot;Mallard&quot;</span>,<br />            BinomialName = <span style=\"color: #a31515\">&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;</span>,<br />          IsEndangered = <span style=\"color: blue\">false</span>,<br />            Population = 50<br />          });\n</pre>\n<p>Nothing tricky here..</p>\n<p>The observatory noticed a population decay, the species is endangered :</p>\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">\n     duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />          .Where(r =&gt; r.Id == speciesId)<br />         .Update(r =&gt; <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span> {<br />              Population = r.Population - 40,<br />              IsEndangered = <span style=\"color: blue\">true</span>});\n</pre>\n<p>Here, the use of the current value of Population will not load current\nvalue. It will the following statement :</p>\n<p>UPDATE Species<br />\nSET<br />\n    Population = Population - 40,<br />\n    IsEndangered = 1<br />\nWHERE<br />\n    Id = @p0</p>\n<p>I chose  to create a new Row from the old one rather than change the\noriginal one for two reasons :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It makes rows immutable and you don’t have to think about execution order\nbetween fields assignments. It’s the way SQL works</li>\n<li>Linq Expressions cannot represent statement blocks and assignments in C#3,\nDuck would have been .Net only…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The –40 is directly in the query here because we used a constant. I we where\nusing a variable, query would contain a parameter</p>\n<p>Now the species has disappeared, it should be removed from the observed\nspecies (though it could be just an update somewhere else) :</p>\n<pre style=\"font-family: consolas\">\n     duck.In&lt;<span style=\"color: #2b91af\">Species</span>&gt;()<br />          .Where(r =&gt; r.Id == speciesId)<br />         .Delete();\n</pre>\n<h2>Testability</h2>\n<p>To run your test you just have to use the InMemoryDuckContext… you have then\naccess to Table&lt;T&gt;() that’ll enable you to set up your data and verify\nafter execution that things changed as expected. I’ll talk a bit more about it\nsoon.</p>\n<h2>Try it now, it’s OSS</h2>\n<p>You can grab the code at bitbucket and try it now :</p>\n<p><a title=\"http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck\" href=\"http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck\" target=\"_blank\">http://bitbucket.org/thinkbeforecoding/duck</a></p>\n<p>It’s in F# !

This method is a method instance to\nhave access to this but will be called only once per class. The registration\nuse Expression&lt;Action&lt;T&gt;&gt; to access the expression tree and extract\nthe method info of the handler. This enables type checking, make R# happy – no\nunused methods – and make reflection not too painful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Good solution.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I didn't go that far because with Event Sourcing, you usually keep\naggregates in memory, so aggregates are instantiated once per service\nlifetime.<br />\nI just crafted a small performance test :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<pre style=\"line-height: normal;

It’s not that complicated.</p>","<p>In the wake of Rinat <a href=\"http://abdullin.com/journal/2012/6/8/technology-demons.html\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Demons</a>, I’d add Mocking frameworks to the list.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are several reasons to do that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Stubs</h3>\n<p>One of the usage of Mocking - or isolation – frameworks is stubbing. A\ncomponent that access external resources or has complex behavior will be\nchanged for a fake to have simpler predictable results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the component interface is small, the stub declaration code is often\nmore complicated that writing a fake implementation directly.</li>\n<li>When the interface has many methods, it makes things easier, but here\nyou’ll ignore a code smell. It makes things easy in situation you should not\nreach !</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also easy patterns that make the use of mocking irrelevant. A\ncommon one is configuration loading.</p>\n<p>Lots of developers think: “I need a class to access my configuration. Let’s\nmake a class for this”:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"font-family: Consolas; font-size: 10pt; color: black; background: white;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">    <span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">class</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">Configuration</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">    {</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">        <span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">string</span>\nEndPoint</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">        {</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">       \n    <span style=\"color: blue;\">get</span> { <span style=\"color: blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">ConfigurationManager</span>.AppSettings[<span style=\"color: #a31515;\">&quot;EndPoint&quot;</span>];

The CheckIn method can be\ndefined by the following method signature:</p>\n<p>int –&gt; State –&gt; Event  or Func&lt;int,State,Event&gt;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Instead of calling an Apply change internally, the method simply returns an\nevent :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>let checkIn count s =<br />\n    <span class=\"keyword keyword_control keyword_control_csharp\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre; line-height: 11.7pt\">if</span>\ncount &lt;= <span class=\"constant constant_numeric constant_numeric_csharp\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre; line-height: 11.7pt\">0</span>\nthen<br />\n       raise (InvalidOperationException<br />\n           <span class=\"string string_quoted string_quoted_double string_quoted_double_csharp\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre; line-height: 11.7pt\">&quot;must have a\ncount greater than 0 to add to inventory&quot;</span>)<br />\n       fire {ItemsCheckedInToInventory.Id= s.Id;\nCount = count}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>where the fire function simply creates a Event array from a single event\n:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>let fire o =<br />\n    [o :&gt; Event]</p>\n<p>(notice the [o:&gt; smiley here !)</p>\n<p>An array is returned here so that a method can fire/return several events\nusing a simple :: syntax.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The state application can also become immutable. The function gives next\nstate based on event and previous state :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>State –&gt; Event –&gt; State or Func&lt;State,Event,State&gt;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>let applyOnInventoryItem s (e: Event) =<br />\n   match e with<br />\n   | :?

Match the\nevent using its type.</p>\n<p>The first event is a creation, so a state record is creates.</p>\n<p>The second events copies state s with Activated set to false. No change\noccurs here, a copy is returned.</p>\n<p>The _ match specifies that any other event simply return previous state.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Done.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The current state is a left fold of passed events</h3>\n<p>Sure and the replayWith method is simply here to do this :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>let replayWith  =</p>\n<p>    Seq.fold</p>\n<p>let replayInventoryItem =</p>\n<p>    replayWith applyOnInventoryItem { Id = Guid.Empty;\nActivated = false}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>the replayInventoryItem is a function that takes a Event seq aka\nIEnumerable&lt;Event&gt;. It will start with the empty state, then for each\nevent, call the applyOnInventoryItem function with previous state, current\nevent, and iterate with new state.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The result is the current state.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Command handlers</h3>\n<p>The event handlers use the following functions :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>let load id =<br />\n   eventStore.GetEventsForAggregate id |&gt;<br />\n   replayInventoryItem</p>\n<p>let save = eventStore.SaveEvents</p>\n<p>let applyOn id version f =<br />\n   load id |&gt;<br />\n   f |&gt;<br />\n   save id version</p>\n<p>load simply pass events for the aggregate with identifier id to the\nreplayInventoryItem</p>\n<p>save is simply a short cut for the event store SaveEvents method</p>\n<p>applyOn loads an aggregate to current state, pass state to f, a function\nthat returns an event seq, then save it to the event store.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here is a sample of its use :</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>member x.Handle (c: CheckInItemsToInventory) =</p>\n<p>   checkIn c.Count |&gt;</p>\n<p>   applyOn c.InventoryItemId c.OriginalVersion<br /></p>\n<p>The checkIn function actually expect an second State argument, it signature\nis int –&gt; State –&gt; Event seq</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After passing the c.Count integer argument this is now a State –&gt; Event\nseq function.</p>\n<p>When passed to the applyOn function, the state issued from the load call\nwill be passed to it, resulting in an Event seq that will be passed to the save\nfunction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>There are a few things to notice in this implementation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is very short, much shorter that C# version.</li>\n<li>There is no InventoryItem class. The InventoryItem module contains a State\nrecord, the representation of the aggregate internal state, functions to\ndetermine raised events, and functions to determine next state based on\nprevious state and event. No base class is needed for event dispatch and\nuncommitted event handling.</li>\n<li>There is no repository. Actually the load and save methods do what a\nrepository does, but it’s so simple that no class is required.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I did not talk about the read model that is a bit less interesting here.</p>","","simplecqrs the version here promised after greg’s talk dddx you can already see all the presentations online version simplecqrs simple quick eventsourcing cqrs sample see action why rewrite this not just simple copy the version the point was first write functional language because event sourcing inherently functional aggregate method looks like this public void checkin int count count throw new invalidoperationexception quot must have count greater than add inventory quot applychange new itemscheckedintoinventory count the applychange method defined the aggregateroot base class dispatches the event state denormalizer and add the event uncommitted changes here denormalizer apply state change following event private void apply inventoryitemdeactivated activated false all this fine but why should the aggregate mutable when the event stream highly append only store immutable events watch greg’s talk carefully both methods can transformed immutable equivalent easily first the goal the public method determine which event raise based command parameters and current state the checkin method can defined the following method signature int state event func int state event instead calling apply change internally the method simply returns event let checkin count count then raise invalidoperationexception quot must have count greater than add inventory quot fire itemscheckedintoinventory count count where the fire function simply creates event array from single event let fire event notice the smiley here array returned here that method can fire return several events using simple syntax the state application can also become immutable the function gives next state based event and previous state state event state func state event state let applyoninventoryitem event match with inventoryitemcreated activated true inventoryitemdeactivated with activated false need for several methods here every thing straight forward match the event using its type the first event creation state record creates the second events copies state with activated set false change occurs here copy returned the match specifies that any other event simply return previous state done the current state left fold passed events sure and the replaywith method simply here this let replaywith seq fold let replayinventoryitem replaywith applyoninventoryitem guid empty activated false the replayinventoryitem function that takes event seq aka ienumerable event will start with the empty state then for each event call the applyoninventoryitem function with previous state current event and iterate with new state the result the current state command handlers the event handlers use the following functions let load eventstore geteventsforaggregate replayinventoryitem let save eventstore saveevents let applyon version load save version load simply pass events for the aggregate with identifier the replayinventoryitem save simply short cut for the event store saveevents method applyon loads aggregate current state pass state function that returns event seq then save the event store here sample its use member handle checkinitemstoinventory checkin count applyon inventoryitemid originalversion the checkin function actually expect second state argument signature int state event seq after passing the count integer argument this now state event seq function when passed the applyon function the state issued from the load call will passed resulting event seq that will passed the save function conclusion there are few things notice this implementation very short much shorter that version there inventoryitem class the inventoryitem module contains state record the representation the aggregate internal state functions determine raised events and functions determine next state based previous state and event base class needed for event dispatch and uncommitted event handling there repository actually the load and save methods what repository does but it’s simple that class required did not talk about the read model that bit less interesting here","a:1:{s:3:\"tag\";a:1:{i:0;s:20:\"CQRS;EventSourcing;F\";}}","1","0","1","1","1","0","0"

After me, Etienne and Maher from Sfeir, did a presentation on the same subject and their architecture inspired by LMAX.</p>\r\n<p>I immediately noticed their reference to this <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html\">Event Sourcing page by Martin Fowler</a>, and started to see several point of pain lurking in their long term maintenance…</p>\r\n<p>I won’t make a flaming post against Martin Fowler that has written lots of interesting stuff. Even this article says nothing wrong. It just takes a way that can cause long term pains as expressed in the page itself…</p>\r\n<h3>Sourcing Events, but which Events ?</h3>\r\n<p>The article starts with a totally valid definition of Event Sourcing:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>  <p>The question then is… where do these events come from ?</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In this case when the service is called, it finds the relevant ship and updates its location. The ship objects record the current known state of the ships.      <br />Introducing Event Sourcing adds a step to this process. Now the service creates an event object to record the change and processes it to update the ship.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> A C# sample a bit further to make it clearer:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"code\">class EventProcessor...\r\nIList log = new ArrayList();\r\npublic void Process(DomainEvent e) {\r\ne.Process();\r\nlog.Add(e);\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>As you can notice, the Event is produced before reaching the event processor…</p>\r\n<p>Constrast this with the following version:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"code\">class Cargo\r\n{\r\nIList log = new List<event>();\r\nprivate State currentState;\r\npublic Cargo(IEnumberable<event> events)\r\n{\r\nforeach(var @event in events)\r\nApply((dynamic) @event);\r\n}\r\npublic void Arrive(Port port)\r\n{\r\n// logic to verify the action can be done\r\n// based on current state and command parameters\r\nif (IsAlreadyInPort) throw Exception();\r\n// create an event of what happened with this action\r\n// it should not mutate state,\r\n// but it can capture external state when it arrives\r\n// it's also based on current state and command parameters\r\nvar @event = new ShipArrived(id, port, DateTime.Now)\r\n// apply change du to the event\r\n// it should require only current state and\r\nApply(@event);\r\nlog.Add(@event);\r\n// events will be published to the rest of the system\r\n// from there..

The output is stored.</p>\r\n<h3>Nice, but why should I care ?</h3>\r\n<p>After all, since Martin says the first version is ok… let’s go !</p>\r\n<p>This would be without noticing several warnings in the rest of the article.</p>\r\n<h3>External Systems</h3>\r\n<p>from the same page:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>One of the tricky elements to Event Sourcing is how to deal with external systems that don't follow this approach (and most don't). You get problems when you are sending modifier messages to external systems and when you are receiving queries from other systems.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the advantages of Event Sourcing stem from the ability to replay events at will, but if these events cause update messages to be sent to external systems, then things will go wrong because those external systems don't know the difference between real processing and replays.</p>\r\n</blockquote>  <p>The second version doesn’t suffer this problem…</p>\r\n<p>Because rebuilding the state (like done in the constructor) only use the Apply method (or the ApplyStateChange function in the functional version)..</p>\r\n<p>This Apply method only works with internal state and produces no external side effects..</p>\r\n<h3>External Queries</h3>\r\n<p>Another problem arising with Martin Fowler’s proposal:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The primary problem with external queries is that the data that they return has an effect on the results on handling an event. If I ask for an exchange rate on December 5th and replay that event on December 20th, I will need the exchange rate on Dec 5 not the later one.</p>\r\n</blockquote>  <p>Here again, the second version doesn’t suffer the problem..</p>\r\n<p>The data from the external system will be used to build the event. It can be directly stored in it (like the current time in the sample), but can also be used in a computation. For instance, command contains prices in USD, query an current rate from USD to EUR, compute a price in EUR and put it in the event.   <br />The rate at the time of the computation is baked in the event ! No need to remember the rate value afterward, especially no need to complex external system gateway.</p>\r\n<p>It could still be better for debugging purpose to put the used rate explicitly in the event.</p>\r\n<p>But the second version intrinsically handles this issue gracefully…</p>\r\n<p>   <h3>     <p>External Interactions</p>\r\n</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Both queries and updates to external systems cause a lot of complication with Event Sourcing. You get the worst of both with interactions that involve both. Such an interaction might be a an external call that both returns a result (a query) but also causes a state change to the external system, such as submitting an order for delivery that return delivery information on that order.&nbsp; </p>\r\n</blockquote>  <p>Problem solved by version 2….</p>\r\n<h3>Code Changes</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>So this discussion has made the assumption that the application processing the events stays the same. Clearly that's not going to be the case. Events handle changes to data, what about changes to code?     <br />[…]      <br />The third case is where the logic itself changes over time, a rule along the lines of \"charge $10 before November 18 and $15 afterwords\". This kind of stuff needs to actually go into the domain model itself. The domain model should be able to run events at any time with the correct rules for the event processing. You can do this with conditional logic, but this will get messy if you have much temporal logic. The better route is to hook strategy objects into a <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/TemporalProperty.html\">Temporal Property</a>: something like <code>chargingRules.get(aDate).process(anEvent)</code>. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/AgreementDispatcher.html\">Agreement Dispatcher</a> for this kind of style.</p>\r\n</blockquote>  <p>Wooo… when I read this, it’s a red flag for me ! I never want to deal with this kind of problems !</p>\r\n<p>Especially if they’re expected to happen for sure !</p>\r\n<p>How does it go with the second version ?</p>\r\n<p>Events are produced by the code that contains the logic. Before November 18, the events emitted where based on code that charge $10. After, the code charges $15.</p>\r\n<p>When using the Apply method, it doesn’t have to know how much to charge, it’s already in saved events !</p>\r\n<p>There is no need to keep an history of versions of domain logic - except in your source control !</p>\r\n<p>It can even cop with changes far more complex that the one in this sample. In any case, all data needed to compute current state has been put in the event.</p>\r\n<h3>Correcting logic bugs</h3>\r\n<p>One of the advantages advanced by Martin Fowler, is that you can change how you take the decision after the fact.</p>\r\n<p>But if an event is an event, it already happened, and there’s no way we can go back in time to change it. We wont be able to change external side effects anyway, so just accept it.</p>\r\n<p>It’s still possible to apply compensations… like accountants. When they charged you to much, they don’t use a time machine to make has if nothing happened.. the just add a chargeback entry at the end of the ledger.</p>\r\n<h3>Command Sourcing ?</h3>\r\n<p>I call the pattern proposed by Martin Fowler Command Sourcing. </p>\r\n<p>A Command is a request made to the system to do something. At this point a lot of thing can still happen. It can fail, it can be influenced by external state..</p>\r\n<p>An event is something that happen and that cannot be changed.</p>\r\n<p>You can protest that an Arrival Event is an event, not a command.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, but for the system it’s an <strong>upstream event</strong>. Not something that happened in the system.</p>\r\n<p>Where’s the difference in the second verions ?</p>\r\n<p>The upstream version will go to a reactor that will produce an Arrive command (notice the present tense) inside the system.   <br />The system will then produce a ShipArrived event (notice the passed tense). This event has been emitted by the system itself.</p>\r\n<p>The Martin Fowler’s version takes a shortcut: bypassing the reactor emitting a command, but it is equivalent to sourcing commands.</p>\r\n<h3>Martin, this is a call to action !</h3>\r\n<p>Since a lot of people have read, and will read the entry on your web site, can you add something about the pattern described here to reduce the pain of people that will want to start with Event Sourcing ?</p>","<p>Last month, I made a presentation about Event Sourcing - a shorter version\nof my DevoxxFr talk.

The better route is to hook strategy objects into a\n<a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/TemporalProperty.html\">Temporal\nProperty</a>: something like\n<code>chargingRules.get(aDate).process(anEvent)</code>. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/AgreementDispatcher.html\">Agreement\nDispatcher</a> for this kind of style.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wooo… when I read this, it’s a red flag for me ! I never want to deal with\nthis kind of problems !</p>\n<p>Especially if they’re expected to happen for sure !</p>\n<p>How does it go with the second version ?</p>\n<p>Events are produced by the code that contains the logic. Before November 18,\nthe events emitted where based on code that charge $10. After, the code charges\n$15.</p>\n<p>When using the Apply method, it doesn’t have to know how much to charge,\nit’s already in saved events !</p>\n<p>There is no need to keep an history of versions of domain logic - except in\nyour source control !</p>\n<p>It can even cop with changes far more complex that the one in this sample.\nIn any case, all data needed to compute current state has been put in the\nevent.</p>\n<h3>Correcting logic bugs</h3>\n<p>One of the advantages advanced by Martin Fowler, is that you can change how\nyou take the decision after the fact.</p>\n<p>But if an event is an event, it already happened, and there’s no way we can\ngo back in time to change it. We wont be able to change external side effects\nanyway, so just accept it.</p>\n<p>It’s still possible to apply compensations… like accountants. When they\ncharged you to much, they don’t use a time machine to make has if nothing\nhappened.. the just add a chargeback entry at the end of the ledger.</p>\n<h3>Command Sourcing ?</h3>\n<p>I call the pattern proposed by Martin Fowler Command Sourcing.</p>\n<p>A Command is a request made to the system to do something. At this point a\nlot of thing can still happen. It can fail, it can be influenced by external\nstate..</p>\n<p>An event is something that happen and that cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>You can protest that an Arrival Event is an event, not a command.</p>\n<p>Sure, but for the system it’s an <strong>upstream event</strong>.

present tense) inside the system.<br />\nThe system will then produce a ShipArrived event (notice the passed tense).\nThis event has been emitted by the system itself.</p>\n<p>The Martin Fowler’s version takes a shortcut: bypassing the reactor emitting\na command, but it is equivalent to sourcing commands.</p>\n<h3>Martin, this is a call to action !</h3>\n<p>Since a lot of people have read, and will read the entry on your web site,\ncan you add something about the pattern described here to reduce the pain of\npeople that will want to start with Event Sourcing ?</p>","","event sourcing command sourcing last month made presentation about event sourcing shorter version devoxxfr talk after etienne and maher from sfeir did presentation the same subject and their architecture inspired lmax immediately noticed their reference this event sourcing page martin fowler and started see several point pain lurking their long term maintenance… won’t make flaming post against martin fowler that has written lots interesting stuff even this article says nothing wrong just takes way that can cause long term pains expressed the page itself… sourcing events but which events the article starts with totally valid definition event sourcing capture all changes application state sequence events the question then is… where these events come from this case when the service called finds the relevant ship and updates its location the ship objects record the current known state the ships introducing event sourcing adds step this process now the service creates event object record the change and processes update the ship sample bit further make clearer class eventprocessor ilist log new arraylist public void process domainevent process log add you can notice the event produced before reaching the event processor… constrast this with the following version class cargo ilist log new list private state currentstate public cargo ienumberable events foreach var event events apply dynamic event public void arrive port port logic verify the action can done based current state and command parameters isalreadyinport throw exception create event what happened with this action should not mutate state but can capture external state when arrives also based current state and command parameters var event new shiparrived port datetime now apply change the event should require only current state and apply event log add event events will published the rest the system from there this where further side effect will occure private void apply shiparrived event decision should happen here currentstate port event port currentstate lastmove event time from functional point view this pattern can build from two pure functions decide command state event list applystatechange state event state here stored event has been produced the aggregate itself the output stored nice but why should care after all since martin says the first version ok… let’s this would without noticing several warnings the rest the article external systems from the same page one the tricky elements event sourcing how deal with external systems that don follow this approach and most don you get problems when you are sending modifier messages external systems and when you are receiving queries from other systems many the advantages event sourcing stem from the ability replay events will but these events cause update messages sent external systems then things will wrong because those external systems don know the difference between real processing and replays the second version doesn’t suffer this problem… because rebuilding the state like done the constructor only use the apply method the applystatechange function the functional version this apply method only works with internal state and produces external side effects external queries another problem arising with martin fowler’s proposal the primary problem with external queries that the data that they return has effect the results handling event ask for exchange rate december 5th and replay that event december 20th will need the exchange rate dec not the later one here again the second version doesn’t suffer the problem the data from the external system will used build the event can directly stored like the current time the sample but can also used computation for instance command contains prices usd query current rate from usd eur compute price eur and put the event the rate the time the computation baked the event need remember the rate value afterward especially need complex external system gateway could still better for debugging purpose put the used rate explicitly the event but the second version intrinsically handles this issue gracefully… external interactions both queries and updates external systems cause lot complication with event sourcing you get the worst both with interactions that involve both such interaction might external call that both returns result query but also causes state change the external system such submitting order for delivery that return delivery information that order problem solved version code changes this discussion has made the assumption that the application processing the events stays the same clearly that not going the case events handle changes data what about changes code the third case where the logic itself changes over time rule along the lines quot charge before november and afterwords quot this kind stuff needs actually into the domain model itself the domain model should able run events any time with the correct rules for the event processing you can this with conditional logic but this will get messy you have much temporal logic the better route hook strategy objects into temporal property something like chargingrules get adate process anevent take look agreement dispatcher for this kind style wooo… when read this it’s red flag for never want deal with this kind problems especially they’re expected happen for sure how does with the second version events are produced the code that contains the logic before november the events emitted where based code that charge after the code charges when using the apply method doesn’t have know how much charge it’s already saved events there need keep history versions domain logic except your source control can even cop with changes far more complex that the one this sample any case all data needed compute current state has been put the event correcting logic bugs one the advantages advanced martin fowler that you can change how you take the decision after the fact but event event already happened and there’s way can back time change wont able change external side effects anyway just accept it’s still possible apply compensations… like accountants when they charged you much they don’t use time machine make has nothing happened the just add chargeback entry the end the ledger command sourcing call the pattern proposed martin fowler command sourcing command request made the system something this point lot thing can still happen can fail can influenced external state event something that happen and that cannot changed you can protest that arrival event event not command sure but for the system it’s upstream event not something that happened the system where’s the difference the second verions the upstream version will reactor that will produce arrive command notice the present tense inside the system the system will then produce shiparrived event notice the passed tense this event has been emitted the system itself the martin fowler’s version takes shortcut bypassing the reactor emitting command but equivalent sourcing commands martin this call action since lot people have read and will read the entry your web site can you add something about the pattern described here reduce the pain people that will want start with event sourcing","a:1:{s:3:\"tag\";a:4:{i:0;s:6:\"Design\";i:1;s:13:\"Martin Fowler\";i:2;s:14:\"Event

!</p>","","monoidal event sourcing examples last time tried imagine how could change usual event sourcing definition get monoidal approach here are some examples make work real life monoids properties try properly and test that the proposed solutions are proper monoids let recap what defines monoid closure operation associativity neutral element how test the closure operation given the signature the operation should have signature like which represents function that takes arguments type and return result the same type for associativity use the following test function let isassociative take function that will called and three values will then test the associativity using fscheck port quickcheck fscheck test the given property for wide range values just have provide the operator and fscheck will check the associativity holds for lot values for the neutral element will use the following test function let isneutralelement neutral neutral neutral here have provide the the operator called inside the function and the neutral element trivial cases there are some obvious trivial cases let try follow the number occurrences specific event state the number time user did something the map function simply let map function theuserdidsomething the combine operation then really simple let combine acc acc and the neutral element obviously need check with fscheck monoid another bit less obvious when event sets value while others don for instance let keep track the last user address when user moves for combination use the right function which always takes rightmost argument let right the adress should course not change other events and for that use option let map function usermoved user newaddress some newaddress none the right function can then tweaked take the right argument only when has value let right match with none right has signature option option option closed operation associative since whatever right right return the last defined term however composed none the neutral element added the left keeps what the right added the right keeps what the left can check with fscheck check quick isneutralelement right none check quick isassociative right less trivial case but what about mixing both some events change the value increments while some other set specific value like stopwatch that increments with button reset can model this kind thing monoid have increment reset value let model discriminated union type changereset change reset map function that map events state change would something like let map function timepassed duration change duration buttonpushed reset change the first two cases are direct mapping for other events use the change values that actually use the neutral element the underlying monoid adding will not change the value have here underlying monoid here talking about duration use numbers with addition and but imagine want add items list but sometime reset the list specific one like the empty list can define high order combine operation like this let combine match with change change change reset change reset reset reset combines changes new change using the underlying monoid operation called here combines changes change the second line states that value reset combined with change will apply the change the value but the third line says that when reset value the right anything overrides what left this operation signature closed the changereset type associative because while combining changes has the associativity the underlying monoid and when combining reset values has the associativity the right operation the neutral element change with the value the neutral element the underlying monoid can verify with fscheck check quick isneutralelement combine change check quick isassociative combine general structure had some remarks that needed group and not only monoid the right and combine function clearly don define group because elements don have inverse opposite what would the opposite reset set the value whatever its left the idea take the set state values then take the set changes from states other states that are represented the events make the union will contain more that valid aggregate states will also contain things that are not state like value that indicate that the state did not change but will ensure the following things the function that convert changes will return items map event the combine operation will closed can accept states from and change from and will closed combine but will also ensure that when state given the left will also return state combine the right operation ensure this the state need value its start you can add many none the right still have value and any new value will return this value for the changereset type the state represented the reset values that are actual values while changes are represented the change values that define long reset value given the outmost left the result will reset value that part with this don need group but can with something that only slightly more restraint than monoid only keep the semantic state but need more that single value course aggregate state usually composed more than single value let start small and consider pair type state and are monoids can easily combine them let combine where the operation and the operation the neutral element simply let neutral neutrala neutralb neutrala neutralb you can easily check that combine closed operation associative and that neutral the neutral element recursively you can build triple pair pair with single element then quadruple and any tuple since structure record just tuple with names any struct with monoidal members also monoid and since event sourcing all the tricky decisions are done before emitting event applying the event should just setting values

We start with C at octave 0, \r\nand have a progression by half tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So C is 0, D is 2, E is 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there is only a half tone between E and F, F is 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F is 7, A is 9, B is 11, and we reach next octave at 12, which is C 1 :</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\">1: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">2:

chords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chords are defined by their root note and the chord quality (major, minor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chords start on the root note, and the chord quality indicates the distance to other notes\r\nto include in the chord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On string instrument, the order and the height of the actual notes are not really important for\r\nthe chord to be ok. So we can use a note at any octave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let's define the chord qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Major, uses the root note, 3rd and 5th,\r\nfor instance for C, it will be C, E, G, which gives intervals of 0, 4 and 7 half tones from root.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\">1: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">2: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">3: </span>\r\n</pre></td>\r\n<td class=\"snippet\"><pre class=\"fssnip highlighted\"><code lang=\"fsharp\"><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs56', 145)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs56', 145)\" class=\"f\">quality</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs52', 146)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs52', 146)\" class=\"f\">notes</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs57', 147)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs57', 147)\" class=\"t\">Set</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs58', 148)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs58', 148)\" class=\"f\">ofList</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs59', 149)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs59', 149)\" class=\"f\">M</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs3', 150)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs3', 150)\" class=\"i\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs56', 151)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs56', 151)\" class=\"f\">quality</span> [<span onmouseout=\"hideTip(event, 'fs3', 152)\" onmouseover=\"showTip(event, 'fs3', 152)\" class=\"i\">n</span> ;

Requiring compilation or a CI server\r\nfor this kind of things usually kills motivation.</p>\r\n<p>Of course it is possible to write bash/batch files but the syntax if fugly once you start to make more advanced\r\ntools.</p>\r\n<p>Python, JavaScript, Ruby or PowerShell are cool, but you end up as often with scripted languages with dynamic typing which you'll\r\ncome to regret when you have to maintain it on the long term.</p>\r\n<p>F# is a staticaly typed language that can be easily scripted. Type inference make it feel like shorter JavaScript but\r\nwith far higher safety !</p>\r\n<p>Writing F# script is easy and fast. Test it from the command line:</p>\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\">1: </span>\r\n</pre></td>\r\n<td class=\"snippet\"><pre class=\"fssnip

So we can create helper scripts that will be included by\r\ncommand scripts.</p>\r\n<p>For instance parsing the command line is often useful so I created a helper:</p>\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\"> 1: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 2: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 3: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 4: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 5: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 6: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 7: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 8: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\"> 9: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">10: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">11: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">12: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">13: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">14: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">15: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">16: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">17: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">18: </span>\r\n</pre></td>\r\n<td class=\"snippet\"><pre class=\"fssnip highlighted\"><code lang=\"fsharp\"><span class=\"c\">// culture invariant, case insensitive string comparison</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">let (==) x y = String.Equals(x,y, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"c\">open System.Xml.Linq</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"c\">module CommandLine =</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">    // get the command line, fck style...</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">    let getCommandLine() = </span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() </span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        |&gt; Array.toList</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        |&gt; List.skipWhile ((&lt;&gt;) &quot;--&quot;)</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        |&gt; List.tail</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"c\">    // check whether the command line starts with specified command</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">    let (|Cmd|_|) str cmdLine =</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        match cmdLine with</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        | s :: _ when s == str -&gt; Some()</span>\r\n<span class=\"c\">        | _ -&gt; None </span>\r\n</code></pre></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>We use the <code>--</code> to delimit arguments reserved for the script.\r\nSince Fake is used to launch scripts, we can also include FakeLib for all the fantastic helpers it contains.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a sample fck-cmd/fck-hello.fsx script that can write hello.</p>\r\n<p>It uses FakeLib for the <code>tracefn</code> function and FckLib for <code>getCommandLine</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You can call it with (once fck is in your Path environment variable):</p>\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\">1: </span>\r\n</pre></td>\r\n<td class=\"snippet\"><pre class=\"fssnip highlighted\"><code lang=\"fsharp\"><span class=\"i\">fck</span> <span class=\"i\">hello</span> <span class=\"i\">Santa</span>\r\n</code></pre></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Help</h2>\r\n<p>A tool without help is just a nightmare, and writing help should be easy.</p>\r\n<p>The last part of fck bash script lanch the fck-help.fsx script:</p>\r\n<p>This script tries to find a fck-xxx.txt file and display it, or fallbacks to fck-help.txt.</p>\r\n<p>For exemple the help for our fck hello command will be in fck-hello.txt:</p>\r\n<table class=\"pre\"><tr><td class=\"lines\"><pre class=\"fssnip\"><span class=\"l\">1: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">2: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">3: </span>\r\n<span class=\"l\">4: </span>\r\n</pre></td>\r\n<td class=\"snippet\"><pre class=\"fssnip highlighted\"><code lang=\"fsharp\"><span class=\"i\">Usage</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\r\n<span class=\"i\">fck</span> <span class=\"i\">hello</span> [&lt;<span class=\"i\">name</span>&gt;]\r\n\r\n<span class=\"i\">Display</span> <span class=\"i\">a</span> <span class=\"i\">friendly</span> <span class=\"i\">message</span> <span class=\"k\">to</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"i\">name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">or</span> <span class=\"k\">to</span> <span class=\"i\">you</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"i\">name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"i\">is</span> <span class=\"i\">omitted</span><span class=\"o\">.</span>\r\n</code></pre></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Of course we can the pimp the fck-help.fsx to parse the txt help files and add codes for colors, verbosity etc.</p>\r\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\r\n<p>Deployment is really easy.

If it does, run it ! It also works with shell scripts name\nfck-$cmd.sh or batch scripts fck-$cmd.cmd to integrate quickly with existing\ntools.</p>\n<h2>Fake for faster startups</h2>\n<p>When F# scripts start to grow big, especially with things like Json or Xml\ntype providers, load time can start to raise above acceptable limits for a\ncli.</p>\n<p>Using Fake to launch scripts takes adventage of it's compilation cache. We\nget the best of both world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>scriptability for quick changes and easy deployment</li>\n<li>automaticly cached jit compilation for fast startup and execution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could have written all commands in a single fsx file and pattern maching\non the command name, but once we start to have more commands, the script\nbecomes bigger and compilation longer. The problem is also that the pattern\nmatching becomes a friction point in the source control.</p>\n<h2>FckLib</h2>\n<p>At some point we have recuring code in the tools.

favorite language the job course scripting body would seriously use compiled language for automation tools requiring compilation server for this kind things usually kills motivation course possible write bash batch files but the syntax fugly once you start make more advanced tools python javascript ruby powershell are cool but you end often with scripted languages with dynamic typing which you come regret when you have maintain the long term staticaly typed language that can easily scripted type inference make feel like shorter javascript but with far higher safety writing script easy and fast test from the command line vim test fsx then write printfn quot merry christmas quot press exit now launch linux with fsharpi exec test fsx windows fsianycpu exec test fsx excellent the only problem that typing the fshapi exec this bit tedious bash batch the rescue can create bash batch script puth the path that will launch the script for linux vim test fsharpi exec test fsx chmod test
